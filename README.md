This project provides users with fast, temporary environments for testing ideas. Our goal is to create a no-signup, lightweight editor that delivers a fun and smooth experience. We currently support Node.js and Python developers, with plans to expand to more languages in the future.

We use npm as our package manager, but we plan to add more options soon!
